# When true, MyiuLib will save block changes in arenas to disk in real time.
# When false, block change data is saved only to memory.
# If you set this to false, you may see a slight performance increase, but if the server crashes or is uncleanly
# shut down (e.g. hitting the "X" button), block change data for active rounds *will be lost*.
# We highly recommend you leave this at its default value (true).
rollback-logging: true

# Defines the level at which MyiuLib and plugins hooking it (if compliant) will log.
# Each level includes messages logged at it as well as at lower levels. Therefore, higher levels typically means more messages.
# SEVERE will log only exceptions and other severe messages. This is not recommended under any circumstances.
# WARNING will log recoverable errors and warnings. This is not recommended, but may be safely used to reduce log density.
# INFO will log status messages and other non-important informational messages. This is recommended for most users.
# DEBUG will log messages intended for debugging purposes only. This is recommended for developers troubleshooting their own plugin.
# VERBOSE will log any messages not contained by the above categories, no matter how insignificant. This is not recommended for anyone unless they know exactly what they're getting themselves into.
logging-level: INFO

# When true, MyiuLib will never use Minecraft's vanilla spectator mode.
# This toggle has been added in case problems arise due to its in-advance implementation.
disable-vanilla-spectating: false

# Should MyiuLib silently download and install updates when available?
# We highly recommend you set this to true so you may run plugins using new API features.
enable-updater: true

# Should MyiuLib submit anonymous statistics to MCStats? (Set to false if you're paranoid.)
enable-metrics: true

# What locale should MyiuLib's messages use?
# This will default to enUS if the locale is undefined, and for messages which are not defined within the locale.
locale: enUS
